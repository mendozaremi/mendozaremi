### Hi there 👋

## About me 😁

My name is Remi Mendoza. I am a Fullstack Developer and 2020 Fullstack Academy graduate. I love Photography, Coding, and Painting.
I am currently practicing the MERN stack and learning many other things along the way.


## What I'm currently learning 📓

I recently have been learning design and everything UX UI through Grow with Google's program.
Currently I am a Student in Google's Android Black+ Android development program.
I love that I am now learning Kotlin but also being apart of such a great community at the same time makes learning alot easier.
I am currently on the job hunt so practicing Algorithms and data structures daily is another thing on my list.

I love "Design to Code" because it teaches you design fundamentals and can the jumpstart you need into to Front-end developer career.

I used to be wedding Photography before coding and still practice photography on occasions.
